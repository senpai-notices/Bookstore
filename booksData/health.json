    "description": "In a study funded by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure® Foundation, Dr. Mary Flynn researched the effects of an olive-oil-and-plant-based diet on overweight women who had previously undergone treatment for invasive breast cancer. Now, she reveals her findings in The Pink Ribbon Diet. Not only is this program more effective than the National Cancer Institute’s recommended low-fat diet, but it is also a diet that women find more satisfying and can thereby sustain for life. The Pink Ribbon Diet features 150 recipes that naturally emphasize Mediterranean foods with nutrients thought to lower breast-cancer risk and foods that improve biomarkers, indicators of risk. This diet has been effective in helping women who have had breast cancer and those at risk of getting it to avoid unhealthy weight gain and safeguard their health.",

On the one hand, you will learn about important research findings from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies that have demonstrated positive effects of religious belief on both mental and physical health. On the other hand, you will learn how the vast clinical experiences of leading health experts suggest that religion can have negative effects on health. Integral to the book's exploration of the relationship between health and religion are the trends that have occurred in society over the last century. You will learn about significant demographic changes, changes in health and health care, and shifts in values, attitudes, and religious conviction, all of which have direct implications for health care providers, the clergy, the “baby boomers,” and older adults. From Author Harold Koenig, a leading expert on religion and health who has frequently been interviewed by major broadcasting networks such as ABC, National Public Radio, the British Broadcasting Corporation, NBC, CBS, and “Ivanhoe Broadcast News,” you will also learn about: pathological uses of religion the need for cooperation and collaboration between health and religious professionals studies on the relationship of religious beliefs and practice to physical conditions such as blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and cancer links between religious behavior and depression, anxiety, and drug use the waning of religion's influence in America first-hand accounts from patients who have faced painful and/or life-threatening illness As Is Religion Good for Your Health? analyzes the pathological aspects of religion, you will begin to understand how religious beliefs have the capacity to strongly influence people's lives and their health, whether positively or negatively. Health care providers, public policy experts, religious professionals, medical researchers, and medical students will find the book's overview of the issues at stake, particularly the implications for our public health care system, crucial to the advancement of health care practice into the next century.",

    "description": "So many diet programs emphasize a gimmick—counting calories, cutting back on carbs—in order to lose weight. Although these measures may result in weight loss, the weight often comes back and your health may be compromised in the process. In order to lose weight safely and easily, you must change the way you view diet and weight loss: Losing weight is not just about getting thinner…it’s about gaining health. Perfect Health: The Natural Way is about feeding your body what it was designed to eat. This program is not about calorie-counting or deprivation, but about eating an abundance of good, healthy food and understanding what your body needs. By concentrating on getting healthy instead of dieting, you will not just lose weight but radiate health and vitality. Combining scientific findings and common sense, Mary-Ann Shearer clears up the confusion surrounding various diets and explains what we need to eat in order to gain total health: What is the “perfect food” that our bodies are designed to eat? Do we really need animal protein in order to be healthy? What is the truth about healthy fats? How does fasting help the body heal? This book explains not just what we should eat and why, but also offers valuable suggestions on how to integrate this new way of eating into your lifestyle. Included is a section featuring delicious, easy-to-prepare, healthy recipes that will help you begin your journey to PERFECT HEALTH!",

    "description": "One of the most important steps that parents can take to prevent childhood obesity or simply to get their children to a healthier weight is to teach them good eating habits. Establishing such habits at an early age will contribute to lifelong health. Indeed, when kids learn that a snack should be an apple or carrots instead of chips or a candy bar-a deceptively difficult lesson to teach-they are better equipped to resist the temptation of junk food on a regular basic. In Raising Healthy Eaters, Dr. Legere offers 100 easy-to-follow and easy-to-implement tips for parents of children of all ages and eating preferences. He includes healthy, quick recipes that kids will actually like, as well as specific suggestions for parents who want to serve only organic foods or whose children have allergies or aversions. Raising Healthy Eaters is the essential resource for parents working to raise healthy kids in a fast-food world.",

    "description": "Imagine that the New York Times tomorrow released some amazing news. A health treatment has been discovered that literally cures most forms of heart disease. But not just that. This treatment has a dramatic impact on most of the diseases Westerners face, including cancer, obesity, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, and many many others. And this treatment is so inexpensive to administer that two-thirds of the medical establishment can be shut down as no longer serving any useful function. It's really too much to believe, isn't it? But there's more. This treatment has miraculous implications for the environment. By applying this treatment, we can eliminate the largest source of global warming, and dramatically reduce the waste that is polluting our water supply. We'll also dramatically improve the health and animal population of our oceans and seas. And there's more. By applying this treatment, we'll dramatically increase the supply of arable land, lowering the cost food and allowing us to feed everyone on this planet. Starvation can become a thing of the past. And one last thing. This treatment also has enormous moral implications, allowing us to eliminate almost all of the pain and suffering we are inflicting on the animals, most of which is hidden away from view, but is morally repulsive to anyone exposed to this suffering. Now what if I told you that we don't have to wait for tomorrow's New York Times, that this treatment has been found, and that the amount of scientific data supporting the claims I just made is overwhelming. The \"miracle\" treatment is simple. It's eating a whole grain, plant-based diet. Skeptical? I'm not surprised. But by the end of this book you'll be exposed to the overwhelming amount of evidence that supports every claim made above. You'll also get to hear the counterarguments made by skeptics and you'll get to decide for yourself whether these claims are true. It's my hope that by the end of this book you'll be convinced and join our movement. You may just save your life and the planet in the bargain. This revolutionary book isHealthy People, Healthy Planet: Unleashing the Power of Plant-based Nutritionby J. Morris Hicks, and it is th book that finally tackles all compelling reasons for adopting a plant-based diet -- from the environment to solving the world's hunger crisis. Additionally, T. Colin Campbell, acclaimed author of the bestselling bookThe China Study, provides a riveting foreword toHealthy People, Healthy Planet. After reading this book, it'll be nearly impossible to ignore the truth: people were not meant to eat animals or animal products, and the time has come to stop.",

While technology advocates advanced nutrition supplements and formulas, we have overlooked what God has created in perfection.Leaves from the Tree of Life is a practical manual based on Biblical principles. Eight chapters are devoted to exploring the basic laws of health (Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Sunlight, Temperance, Air, Rest, and Trust in Divine Power), and showing how these principles can help enhance, and lengthen the individual's life.Extensive research was consulted when composing this manual, yet it is written in a simple, understandable format with specific ways to make these principles into reality, including 79 pages of nutritious recipes.Edited by Milton G Crane, M.D., FACP, Director of Medical Research at Weimar Institute, this manual has a solid medical basis which sets it above many other publications of its kind.\"I am very pleased with this book; it will be a great asset in working with your students and in presenting your seminars. I believe it will fill a much needed spot in education of lay persons in the basic laws of health. It is well documented and very nicely laid out.\" - Agatha Thrash, M.D. Uchee Pines Institute.Leaves from the Tree of Life is a manual of basic health principles based on the 8 Laws of Health. The author's explore God's plan for feeling better and living longer, and offer practical tips to promote a healthy lifestyle including exercise, diet and spirituality.

    "description": "As a drug chemist for a leading pharmaceu-tical company I made a startling discovery: you do not have to be dependent on FDA approved drugs to, avoid heart disease. In fact, research clearly shows the opposite. You don't need a single prescription drug to avoid this killer. The best selling drugs of all time are the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as \"statins\". They procure drug makers and their shareholders billions of dollars in profits every year. The success of these drugs is not attributed to their effectiveness but instead to slick and misleading marketing practices. This hype is fueled by egregious conflicts of interest amongst drug company servants disguised as experts. Don't I be surprised if your own doctor falls within this group. The truth be told, statin drugs are poisons - foreign to the human body and may at times be, life threatening. Avoiding heart disease should not be expensive or dangerous. A plethora of natural alternatives exist. Understanding them as outlined in this paradigm shifting book will arm you with the understanding and courage not to accept popular dogma. It may prove to be one of the greatest assets to your health.",

They were thrilled—until they discovered that the magic ingredient was formaldehyde. Shocked, O’Connor and Spunt left no bottle unturned. If it went on their body (and thus, was absorbed into their skin and bloodstream), they researched it. As it turns out, many of those unpronounceable ingredients in your self-tanner and leave-in conditioner are not regulated and the “natural” on your face wash doesn’t mean what you think it does. Now, with the help of top scientists, dermatologists, and makeup artists, the authors share their compelling findings and the easy way to detoxify your beauty regimen. No More Dirty Looks also reveals the safest, most effective products on the market and time-tested home recipes. Finally, you don’t need to sacrifice health for beauty—because coming clean is the best look yet.",

The concept is simple and flexible: eat fewer calories and choose foods carefully. Longtime CR practitioners and experts Brian M. Delaney and Lisa Walford clearly explain all the relevant health and nutrition guidelines and provide the tools you need to make the appropriate dietary changes. The results can be dramatic; those who follow CR have quickly lowered their cholesterol and blood pressure and reduced their body fat. Recently featured on Oprah and 60 Minutes, CR is continuing to gain momentum. With updated research and new information about exercise and food choices, The Longevity Diet is the key to a longer, healthier life.",

Chuck Runyon, Brian Zehetner, and Rebecca DeRossett are here to confirm what you already know: Working out sucks. The good news? With the new approaches in this book, that is about to change. Working Out Sucks! deprograms those of us who have long been brainwashed by unhealthy habits, destructive attitudes, and misinformation about health, and offers a no-nonsense way to get back on track. Because, while working out may suck, the alternatives—from heart disease to premature aging and shortened lifespan--are a lot worse. As he does in his 1,700 Anytime Fitness clubs (with more than one million members worldwide--and growing), Runyon emphasizes user-friendliness and utility in this get-real, get-healthy message, complete with Zehetner’s 21-day kick-start plan and DeRossett’s tips for mental health.",

    "description": "Joan Price is talking out loud about later-life sexuality. With a foreword by Betty Dodson, Naked at Our Age candidly addresses senior sexuality in all its colors—the challenges, disappointments, and surprises, as well as the delights and the love stories. Naked at Our Age gives people over fifty a voice to tell stories of their past and present sex lives, ask questions, and get straightforward advice and information from experts. No topic is off-limits. ?In Naked at Our Age, women and men—coupled and single, straight and gay—talk candidly about how their sex lives and relationships have changed with age, and about how they see themselves, their partners, or their single life. Many are having unsatisfying sex, or no sex at all, and are seeking advice. Price presents their personal stories, and follows up with tips from sex therapists, health professionals, counselors, sex educators, and other knowledgeable experts. Named \"Outstanding Self-Help Book” of 2012 by the American Society of Journalists and Authors and winner of the 2012 Book Award from the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists, Naked at Our Age is an entertaining and indispensable guide to handling and understanding the issues of senior sex and relationships.",

The development of the field is reflected in the growth of disciplines such as health psychology, psychosocial epidemiology, and behavioural medicine. The basic literature is however awkwardly dispersed across medical and social science journals. This book makes available within a single volume some of the most important articles that have been published over the past thirty years. The thirty-one articles are grouped round six themes: life stress, social support and health; psychophysiological processes in disease; personality, behaviour patterns and health; health practices and the modification of health risk behaviour; coping with illness and disability; behavioural interventions in medicine. Each is prefaced by a state-of-the-art review of the theme by the editors. These readings will serve as a most valuable resource for psychology and health science teachers and students alike.",

In Foodwise she presents a cornucopia of ideas, advice and commentary, informed by the work of Rudolf Steiner. Cook relates human evolution to changes in consciousness and the consumption of different foods, considering among other topics the importance of agricultural methods, the nature of the human being, the significance of grasses and grains, the mystery of human digestion and the question of vegetarianism. She also analyzes the nutritional (or otherwise) qualities of carbohydrates, minerals, fats and oils, milk and dairy products, herbs and spices, salt and sweeteners, stimulants, legumes, the nightshade family, bread, water and dietary supplements. She ends this comprehensive survey of nutrition with practical tips on cooking, planning menus, children's food and sharing meals--and some mouth-watering recipes!",

Some stress gets you ready for the day's experiences (I want to get to work on time). Other stress can have negative influences on your life (the speeding ticket received while trying to get to work on time). Our perspective toward how we view various stress points will determine whether stress is helpful or hurtful. If we learn the biblical principles of dealing with stress, we will be equipped to live holy and happy lives.",

In this provocative book, Mark Nathan Cohen challenges this belief. Using findings from epidemiology, anthropology, and archaeology, Cohen provides fascinating evidence about the actual effects of civilization on health, suggesting that some aspects of 'progress' create as many health problems as they prevent or cure.",

Today, many people are trying to discover and fulfill God’s purpose and plan for their lives. Do you know what His assignment is for you? Maybe you’ve felt God direct you or call you to a certain type of ministry, but struggle to embrace your God-given design. Or perhaps you’re already involved in service to God, but beneath your proper attire and eloquent words you’re just plain tired. Fit for Your Assignment will awaken a new desire and passion to rise up and change patterns and behaviors (spiritual and physical) for the fulfillment of your God-given purpose. You will be inspired to examine key areas of your life that are critical to the fulfillment of your assignment, including: · Spiritual health · Eating well and weight loss · Overcoming habits and addictions · Proper rest and stress reduction, and more Through the lens of scripture and inspiring stories of others who have been transformed by these principles, you will walk through four steps for true transformation as you learn the importance of caring and ministering to your whole self, body--mind, and spirit.",
